Speedup and Efficiency in Parallel Computing 
The difference in between them is the time that a processer of a computer takes to be able to process and implemented the instructions inputted into the system. 
Each has a specific mathmatical equation on how to compute the different time it takes to process the instruction using the variables of how many instruction are given, the amount of processors used, and the implementation work done.
